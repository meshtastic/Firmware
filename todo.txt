A non-exhaustive task list

Features
====================
[]      adhoc ping
[]      canned message
[]      map scale indicator 
[]      boot screen
[]      shutdown screen
[]      eink drivers for other devices
[]      gps menu
[]      mini-compass on nodelist
[]      additional user applets
[wip]   add extended ascii / foreign language chars - Fonts for Windows-1250, Windows-1251 (Windows-1252?)


Critical Tasks
====================
[tbc]   fix attach/detach interrupts for ButtonThread.cpp
            - check with older ESP32 variants
[]      imperial units
[]      ble pairing screen
[]      boot and shutdown screens
[]      hook reboot to save flash data

Improvements
====================
[]      Nodelist applet should fill new space from NodeDB when layout changes and applet size increases, or when recents duration increases
[]      Better detection of position changes in PositionsApplet
[]      Don't show signal strength in ChronoListApplets if hops unknown
[]      Refactor WindowManager::render
[]      Refactor ChronoList applets
[]      Handle layout / applet changes with render(), instead of the "stale render" technique
[]      ChronoListApplet should only requestUpdate for changed signal strength if node 0-hops (showing signal bars)
[]      Descriptive headers for some settings in menu
[]      Re-render applets when RTC is set. Some UI elements change (e.g. "Recents" applet counts)

Known Bugs
=====================
[]      ChronoList applets: no event raised on nodeinfo rx
[]      (Rare) phantom user button short-press on T-Echo when unattended for extended period
[]      Timestamps don't update. Needs to happen once a day. "6PM -> Yesterday". Make the WindowManager do it.
[]      Lightsleep shouldn't be possible while update in progress. Set canSleep=false? 
[]      Root menu: header breaks spacing if rtc set while menu open
[]      Applets don't re-render when node is removed via admin command
[]      Autoshow focusing oldest of two competing requests, if render is deferred
[]      (Rare) Recents List: count in header label may not match number of items shown

Chores
==========
[]      Make runOnce methods private
[]      Helper method in InkHUD::Drivers::EInk to simplify framebuffer arithmetic, for anyone else using NicheGraphics
[]      Don't repeat logs from Applet::getTimeString
[]      honour "max tiles" setting in nicheGraphics.h
[]      Remove parentheses from methods mentioned in comments, to make code search easier
