A non-exhaustive task list

Features
====================
[]      adhoc ping
[]      canned message
[]      backlight toggle
[]      map scale indicator 
[]      boot screen
[]      shutdown screen
[]      secondary buttons
[]      eink drivers for other devices
[]      gps menu
[tbc]   autoshow
[]      mini-compass on nodelist
[wip]   notifications / vetos
[]      additional user applets
[wip]   add extended ascii / foreign language chars


Critical Tasks
====================
[tbc]   fix attach/detach interrupts for ButtonThread.cpp
            - check with older ESP32 variants
[]      imperial units
[]      optimize fast / full referesh: less blinking
[]      handle emoji in shortname
[]      ble pairing screen
[]      boot and shutdown screens
[]      hook reboot to save flash data
[tbc]   Split requestUpdate and requestAutoshow

Improvements
====================
[]      Nodelist applet should fill new space from NodeDB when layout changes and applet size increases, or when recents duration increases
[]      Better detection of position changes in PositionsApplet
[]      Don't show hops in nodelist applets if unknown
[]      Refactor WindowManager::render
[]      Refactor ChronoList applets
[]      Handle layout / applet changes with render(), instead of the "stale render" technique
[]      ChronoListApplet should only requestUpdate for changed signal strength if node 0-hops (showing signal bars)
[]      Descriptive headers for some settings in menu
[]      Re-render applets when RTC is set. Some UI elements change (e.g. "Recents" applet counts) 

Known Bugs
=====================
[tbc]   detect userinfo (lastheard)
[]      stuck if long-ish button press
[]      T-Echo frontlight: remains on if shutdown while active
[]      (Rare) phantom user button short-press on T-Echo when unattended for extended period
[]      Timestamps don't update. Needs to happen once a day. "6PM -> Yesterday". Make the WindowManager do it.
[]      Lightsleep shouldn't be possible while update in progress. Set canSleep=false? 
[]      Root menu: header breaks spacing if rtc set while menu open
[]      Applets don't re-render when node is removed via admin command
[]      Incorrect number of lines in threaded message display. (When '\n' is used. With long text such as URL)
[]      Autoshow focusing oldest of two competing requests, if render is deferred

Chores
==========
[]      Make runOnce methods private
[]      Helper method in InkHUD::Drivers::EInk to simplify framebuffer arithmetic, for anyone else using NicheGraphics
[]      Don't repeat logs from Applet::getTimeString
[]      honour "max tiles" setting in nicheGraphics.h
[]      Remove parentheses from methods mentioned in comments, to make code search easier
